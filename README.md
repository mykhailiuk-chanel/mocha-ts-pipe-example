# Simple Template for Testing Project with Mocha + TypeScript

üöÄ Welcome to the Simple Template for Testing Project with Mocha + TypeScript! This project serves as a basic template for getting started with testing using Mocha along with TypeScript. In this template, you'll find an example function `pipe`, which is part of the project and has its own tests.

## Description of the `pipe` Function

The `pipe` function is designed to compose and sequentially execute other functions. It takes functions as arguments and executes them one after the other, passing the output of one function as the input to the next.

## Tests

In this project, there are several tests to verify the functionality of the `pipe` function. The tests verify whether the `pipe` function returns the expected results in various usage scenarios. For example, the tests verify whether the `pipe` function correctly adds one to the input value, multiplies the input value by two, and so on.

## How to Run the Tests

1. After cloning or downloading the project, navigate to its directory in your terminal.
2. Run the command `npm install` to install all project dependencies.
3. Once the dependencies are installed, run the command `npm test` to execute all tests.
4. After running the tests, you'll see the results in the console.

## Requirements

To run this project successfully, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer.
